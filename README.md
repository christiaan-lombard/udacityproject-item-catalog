## Udacity Project Specifications

You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

### Project Display Example

**Note: The screenshots on this page are just examples of one implementation of the minimal functionality. You are encouraged to redesign and strive for even better solutions.**

The Item Catalog project consists of developing an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories, as well as provide a user registration and authentication system.



**In this sample project, the homepage displays all current categories along with the latest added items.**

**Selecting a specific category shows you all the items available for that category.** 
*http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboarding/items*

**Selecting a specific item shows you specific information of that item.**
*http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboarding/Snowboard*

**After logging in, a user has the ability to add, update, or delete item info.**
*http://localhost:8000/ (logged in)*

*http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboarding/Snowboard (logged in)*

*http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboard/edit (logged in)*

**The application provides a JSON endpoint, at the very least.**
*http://localhost:8000/catalog.json*
